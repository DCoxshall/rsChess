# rsChess
This repository is a place for me to screw around with Rust, focusing on a theme
I enjoy: chess. 

Initially I tried to build an entire engine. I realised pretty quickly that a
full-blown chess engine is way too complicated for me to build right now, given
the time I'd have to devote as well as my knowledge of Rust. 
Right now, I'm focusing on building an AI that will hopefully play the game
moderately well. 

What I'm trying to get across is: Don't take this repo seriously. Maybe one day
I'll be good enough to implement a full engine.
